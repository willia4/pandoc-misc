# Readme
[Pandoc][] is an amazing document processor that I've recently fallen in love with. Pandoc is, among other things, currently my [markdown][] processor of choice. This is basically my ~/.pandoc directory put in source control form. 

At the time of this writing, it consists of an html template that matches my website style. I use this template both at the command line and also with the [SublimePandoc][] plugin for the [Sublime Text 2][sublime] text editor. 

All code in this directory is under the [MIT Open Source License][mit].
